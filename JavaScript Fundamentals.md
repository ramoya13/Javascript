## operators

/*A group of words, numbers and operators that perform tasks is a **statement**
A group of references and values combined  with operators wich result in a value is an **expression** */

## Variables

Allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion /*use a label to point to the data*/
-ie var ourName;

-var
-let
  -value can change any time we want
-const /*Immutable: ie their values canot change*/
/*Initialization-Declearing and giving a variable its value*/
