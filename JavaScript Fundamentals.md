# Javascript Fundamentals


## <script>
  Can be used to insert javascript into html documents
  Complex scripts reside outside html
  <script>
    alert('Hello, World');
  </script>
  
## statements
  syntax constructs and commands that perform functions
  i.e alert('Hello, World')
  Usually writenn on separate lines for readability
  
  ## 'use strict'/ the modern way -supports classes and modules
  

## Types
-Javascript types are dynamic i.e same variable can be use to store different types of data
-string "Any text"
  -set of character enclosed in a quotation
-number  123.45
-boolean true or false
-undefined undefined - variables with no assigned values
-symbol symbol{"something"}
  **nul** -signifies intentionl absence of data
  **typeof** function returns the type of variable
-object {key: "value"}
  -objects are written with curly brackets
>array {1, "text", false} /*array items are separated by a comma*/ and square brackets are used house the array items
>function function name() {}

## operators

Operators are reserved words that perform actions on values
= + - / *
/*A group of words, numbers and operators that perform tasks is a **statement**
A group of references and values combined  with operators wich result in a value is an **expression** */
  
## Logical Operators

## Variables

A named reference to a value
Allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion /*use a label to point to the data*/
-ie var ourName;
store values to refer to it later in the code
-var
-let
  -value can change any time we want
-const /*Immutable: ie their values canot change*/
/*Initialization-Declearing and giving a variable its value*/
